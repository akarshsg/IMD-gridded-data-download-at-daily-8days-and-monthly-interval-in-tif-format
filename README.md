# IMD-gridded-data-download-at-daily-8days-and-monthly-interval-in-tif-format
IMD Weather Data Downloader:
This repository contains Python code for downloading open acess Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) weather data for the Indian region. The script fetches Rainfall, Tmin (Minimum Temperature), and Tmax (Maximum Temperature) data at different temporal resolutions and spatial resolutions.
certain portion of the code is directly taken from IMDLIB python libaray and further developed to retrive data in geotiff format.

Data Features:
Data is generated at daily, 8-days and monthly intervals using this code. (Incase of 8 days and monthly, sum for (Rainfall) and mean for Tmin and Tmax were used)
Spatial resolution for Rainfall: 0.25 degrees.
Spatial resolution for Tmax and Tmin: 1 degree.

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script to download the desired weather data.

Naming convention used:
Daily files: IMDTmin_yyyy-mm-dd eg: IMDTmin_2000-01-01.tif
8 days files: IMDTmin_yyyy-mm-dd. where date represents first day of 8 consecutive days. eg: IMDTmin_2000-01-01.tif, IMDTmin_2000-01-09.tif ......
Monthly files: IMDTmin_yyyy-mmm. eg: IMDTmin_2000_Jan.tif, IMDTmin_2000_Feb.tif......

Tmean file has been generated by taking mean of Tmax and Tmin 

Dependencies:
Python
Feel free to use and modify the code as needed. Contributions are welcome!
